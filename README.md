PocketPipe: A computational pipeline for integrated Pocketome prediction and comparison

PocketPipe with seamless integration of robust algorithms namely, P2Rank and PocketMatch,
for pocketome generation and comparison, respectively. the pipeline proves to be efficient 
in terms of seamless operability, high scalability, dynamic file handling and optimal utilization
of CPU for computationally demanding tasks. PocketPipe is distributed freely under GNU GPL license.
